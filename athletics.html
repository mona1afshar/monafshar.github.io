										<h2 class="major">Competitive Swimming</h2>
										<p>When I first started swimming competitively at age 10, I had no idea how rigorous the training would be. In my second year, I was placed in a group with a coach who had a reputation for being tough. I vividly remember my first practice with the new coach, and it was a mental challenge. The coach yelled at me repeatedly for not pushing myself to my full potential. I was ready to quit and go home after that first practice. But, I realized that if I quit, I wouldn't be able to race anymore or go to the pool everyday.

											Despite the difficulties, I pushed myself to stay the entire year. The first few months were tough, and I often found myself crying behind my goggles during practice. However, this experience made me mentally stronger. That year, I trained both physically and mentally at my hardest, and it was also the year I fell in love with the sport. If I had given up after the first practice and never swam again, I wouldn't have learned how to work hard and be determined. Swimming has given me a stronger mentality, not just for competition, but also in my academics. Swimming has taught me exceptional time management skills because I have had to balance training for over 16 hours per week, completing homework, and participating in other leadership activities.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Gymnastics</h2>
                                        <p>At the age of 4, I was filled with terror when I was enrolled in my first gymnastics class. The sight of those big bars, trampolines, and mats was quite daunting. As I watched my sister attend gym classes over the years, my interest in the sport slowly developed. Finally, at the age of 7, I re-entered a gymnastics class and fell in love with it. I continued to practice and learn skills until I turned 12. Even though I never pursued gymnastics competitively, it remains one of my favorite leisure activities. Through gymnastics, I learned about courage and dedication. Regardless of how challenging the skills became or how scared I was to attempt a particular move, I persisted until I eventually accomplished it. The feeling of accomplishment I experienced after successfully completing a skill brought me immense joy and satisfaction. Gymnastics is a sport that I will always cherish and continue to practice when the opportunity arises.</p>
