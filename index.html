										<h2 class="major">Nice to meet you!</h2>
										<p>I am Mona Afshar, a 12th grade student enrolled in the MaCS (Math and Computer Science) program at William Lyon Mackenzie C.I. Although my parents were raised in Iran, I was born and brought up in Toronto, Ontario. With my father and older sister both having a knack for computer programming, I have also developed a passion for it and aspire to pursue it in the future. Sports have always been an essential part of my life, as a competitive swimmer and former gymnast. To learn more about me and my hobbies, please refer to the menu at the top of the page or check out the links to my social media accounts below.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Competitve Swimming</h2>
										<p>Since 2015, I've been a competitive swimmer with the North York Aquatic Club (NYAC). I began my training at the age of 11, which was later than most of my teammates, but this only fueled my motivation to work harder and catch up to them. Starting with just three hours of training per week, I gradually increased my dedication and commitment to the sport, eventually reaching 16 hours a week. Swimming demands immense perseverance, as it involves spending long hours staring at the black line, but this has taught me the importance of time management. Balancing 16+ hours of training with a full course load at school and extracurricular activities is no easy feat, but it has helped me develop valuable skills and discipline.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
									<p>I've been working on a variety of projects at school and in my spare time over the last few years. I learnt to write in Java and Processing in my high school computer science class, which taught me the principles of programming. In my spare time, I've been learning website development and have used HTML, CSS and javascript to make this and other websites. To see all of my recent work, check out my github page, or press learn more to view my projects page.</p>
