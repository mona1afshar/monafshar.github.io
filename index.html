										<p>My name is Mona Afshar, I'm a grade 10 Student in the MaCS program at William Lyon Mackenzie C.I. I've been born and raised in Toronto, Ontario although my parents both grew up in Iran. 2 years before I was born my parents came to Canada to provide a better life for my sister and I. As a MaCS(Math and Computer Science) program student, I'm an aspiring Software Engineer. Following the footsteps of my father and my older sister, I have a passion for computer programming. I also have a passion for athletics, as a competitive swimmer and former gymnast, I have always considered sports to be a necessity in my life.

										<h2 class="major">Competitve Swimming</h2>
										<p>I have been swimming competitively with North York Aquatic Club since 2015. I started competing at the age of 11 which was later than most of my teammates. This taught me to work even harder to catch up to them and to stay motivated. When I first started swimming I would train 3 hours a week, but as I improved I started swimming for 7, 10 and eventually 16 hours a week. Swimming is a sport that requires an extreme amount of passion and resilience because of the endless hours of staring at the black line at the bottom of the pool.</p>
