										<h2 class="major">Nice to meet you!</h2>
										<p>I am Mona Afshar, a Systems Design Student at the University of Waterloo! I just graduated from the MaCS (Math and Computer Science) program at William Lyon Mackenzie C.I in Toronto. With my father and older sister both having a knack for computer programming, I have also developed a passion for it and aspire to pursue it in the future. As a former competitive swimmer and gymnast, sports have always been an essential part of my life. To learn more about me and my hobbies, please refer to the menu at the top of the page or check out the links to my social media accounts below.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Competitve Swimming</h2>
										<p>I started swimming competitively at age 10 with the North York Aquatic Club (NYAC) and I continued the sport through middle and high school. Starting with just three hours of training per week, I gradually increased my dedication and commitment to the sport, eventually reaching 16 hours a week. Swimming demands immense perseverance, as it involves spending long hours staring at the black line on the bottom of the pool, but this has taught me the importance of time management. Balancing 16+ hours of training with a full high school course load and extracurricular activities wass no easy feat, but it has helped me develop valuable skills and discipline. Although, I have since retired from competing, I still find time to head to the pool for a swim to clear my mind.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
									<p>I've been working on a variety of projects at school and in my spare time over the last few years. I learnt to write in Java, Processing, C and C++ in my classes, which taught me the principles of programming. In my spare time, I've been learning website development and have used HTML, CSS and javascript to make this and other websites. To see all of my recent work, check out my github page, or press learn more to view my projects page.</p>
